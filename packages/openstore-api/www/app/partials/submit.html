            </li>
            <li>
                You are only allowed to publish apps that you have permission to
                distribute.
            </li>
            <li>
                You app can be pulled without warning at the discretion of our
                admins. Where possible we will contact you regarding any such
                actions.
            </li>
            <li>

                Send us a link to a branch for your app to our
                <a href="https://launchpad.net/~openstore-team">mailing list</a>
                or our
                <a href="https://telegram.me/joinchat/BMTh8AHtOL2foXLulmqDxw">telegram group</a>.
                along with some instructions on how to build it if they differ
                from the standard (Ubuntu SDK).
            </li>
            <li>
                Give a short explanation why you can’t publish the app without
                extra privileges. No need to go into details, a one liner like "needs to run
                a daemon in the background" will do. List all the special features you have,
                if there are more.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an application could be published without manual review
                if it wouldn’t be for that one cool feature, publish a stripped
                down version! Not everyone will want to install apps with less
                confinement.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only open source applications allowed for manual review: As the
                applications might have arbitrary access to the device, every
                manually reviewed app will get a source code review.
