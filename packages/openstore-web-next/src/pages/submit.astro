    <h2 class="text-2xl">Rules for Submission</h2>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>Apps not requiring manual review can be submitted by logging in with the "Log In" link above.</li>
      <li>You are only allowed to publish apps that you have permission to distribute.</li>
      <li>You are not allowed to impersonate someone else or another app.</li>
      <li>
        Your app can be pulled without warning at the discretion of our admins. Where possible, we will contact you regarding any such
        actions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/telegram">Apps requiring manual review must be submitted by contacting an admin in our telegram group.</a>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Rules for Submissions Requiring Manual Review</h2>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>
        <a href="/telegram">
          Send us a link to a repository for your app to our telegram group along with some instructions on how to build it.
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Give a short explanation why you can't publish the app without extra privileges. No need to go into details, a one liner like "needs
        to run a daemon in the background" will do. List all the special features you have, if there are more.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an application could be published without manual review if it wouldn't be for that one cool feature, publish a stripped down
        version! Not everyone will want to install apps with less confinement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only open source applications allowed for manual review: As the applications might have arbitrary access to the device, every
        manually reviewed app will get a source code review.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">OpenStore App Content Policy</h2>

    <p>
      One of the main goals of the OpenStore is to provide a safe app store for people of all ages. To accomplish this goal we do not allow
      certain types of app to be published. Failure to follow the guidelines will result in your app being removed. Any account with serious
      infractions may be subject to termination. The OpenStore team thanks you for helping us promote a better enviroment for everyone.
