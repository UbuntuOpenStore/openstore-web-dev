    <p>
      The OpenStore is the official app store for Ubuntu Touch. It is an open source project run by a team of volunteers with help from the
      community. You can discover and install new apps on your Ubuntu Touch device. You can also upload and manage your own apps for
      publication. The OpenStore encourages the apps published within to be open source, but also accepts proprietary apps.

    <p>
      The OpenStore a non-profit volunteer project. Although every effort is made to ensure that everything in the repository is safe to
      install, you use it AT YOUR OWN RISK. Apps uploaded to the OpenStore will be subject to an automated review process or a manual review
      process to check for potential security or privacy issues. This checking is far from exhaustive though, and there are no guarantees.
    </p>

    <p>
      The OpenStore respects your privacy. We don't track you or your device. You do not need an account to download and install apps and we
      do not track your downloads. For developer information we count the number of downloads per app revision. Information about your
      device (the cpu architecture, framework versions, OS version, and OS language) are sent to the server to allow it to filter apps to
      only what you can install and present your native language where possible. This information is not logged or stored and cannot be used
      to uniquely identify you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any personal data you decide to give us (e.g. your email address when registering for an account to upload your apps) goes no further
      than us, and will not be used for anything other than allowing you to maintain your apps and, in rare cases, contact you in the event
      there is an issue with your app. Additionally, this site uses cookies to keep you logged in to your account.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apps uploaded to the OpenStore are subject to our submission rules and content policy. You can review the rules and policies before
      uploading your app.
